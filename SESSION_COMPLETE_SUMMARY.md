## üéØ **Next Actions for You**

### **Immediate (Next 10 Minutes):**
1. **Check if Railway deployed:**
   ```bash
   curl https://signal-railway-deployment-production.up.railway.app/tokens/trending
   ```
   - If you see JSON with "count" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Deployed!
   - If you see "Not Found" ‚Üí Wait 5 more min

2. **Apply data accuracy fixes to Lovable:**
   - Copy `LOVABLE_DATA_ACCURACY_PROMPT.md`
   - Paste into your Lovable dashboard chat
   - Say: "Apply these data accuracy rules to all pages"

### **This Week:**
3. **Verify dashboard shows real data:**
   - Open Lovable dashboard
   - Check every metric has "Source: /xyz endpoint"
   - Verify "Last updated: X ago" appears
   - Confirm no fake/placeholder data

4. **Run cleanup script (optional, for testing):**
   ```bash
   # On Railway, run cleanup script
   railway run python3 cleanup_old_data.py
   ```

### **Monthly Maintenance:**
5. **Monitor volume usage** - Check Railway dashboard
6. **Run cleanup script** - Delete old signals/trades (>90 days)
7. **Check scanner metrics** - Verify signals generating
