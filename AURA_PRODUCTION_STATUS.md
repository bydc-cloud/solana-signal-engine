## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Today)
1. **Test ChatGPT Brainstorming**
   ```bash
   cat CHATGPT_BRAINSTORM_PROMPT.md
   # Copy to ChatGPT for strategic architecture discussion
   ```

2. **Test Voice Interface**
   - Open: https://signal-railway-deployment-production.up.railway.app/jarvis
   - Say: "Show me the top whale wallets"
   - Verify: Audio response + visual cards

3. **Monitor Active Wallets**
   - Check dashboard regularly
   - Watch for new trades
   - Verify win rates update correctly

### This Week
4. **Replace Test Wallets**
   - Current: 158/162 wallets are inactive (return 400 errors)
   - Need: 50+ real high-performing Solana whale addresses
   - Sources: Solscan top traders, Twitter CT, DexScreener whales

5. **Implement Background Jobs**
   - Choose: APScheduler (easiest) or Railway Cron (built-in)
   - Schedule: Whale tracking every 5 minutes
   - Monitor: Check for API rate limit issues

6. **Expand MCP Memory Graph**
   - Store ALL 4 active wallets in knowledge graph
   - Add token entities (what they trade)
   - Create more relationships (wallet→token→trades)
   - Test complex queries

### This Month
7. **Migrate to PostgreSQL**
   - Reason: SQLite has concurrent write limitations
   - Cost: $10/month Railway addon
   - Benefit: Handle 100+ concurrent users

8. **Add Monitoring**
   - Sentry for error tracking (free tier)
   - Better Uptime for health checks (free tier)
   - Railway built-in metrics (free)

9. **Implement WebSocket Broadcasting**
   - Add Redis Pub/Sub ($5/month Railway addon)
   - Broadcast whale trades to all connected clients
   - Show live notifications in dashboard

10. **Upgrade Helius API**
    - Current: Free tier (100 req/day) - insufficient
    - Upgrade: Pro tier ($50/mo, 10k req/day)
    - Benefit: Track all 162 wallets every 5 minutes

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical
1. **Most wallets inactive**: 158/162 wallets return 400 errors from Helius (invalid addresses)
   - **Impact:** Only 4 wallets showing real data
   - **Fix:** Replace test addresses with real whale wallets
   - **Timeline:** This week

2. **No background job scheduler**: Tracking must be triggered manually via API
   - **Impact:** Data not updating automatically
   - **Fix:** Add APScheduler or Railway Cron
   - **Timeline:** This week

3. **SQLite concurrent write limit**: Will break with multiple simultaneous tracking runs
   - **Impact:** System crashes under load
   - **Fix:** Migrate to PostgreSQL
   - **Timeline:** This month

### Medium Priority
4. **Helius rate limit**: Free tier (100 req/day) insufficient for 162 wallets
   - **Current:** Can only track ~10 wallets per hour
   - **Fix:** Upgrade to Helius Pro ($50/mo, 10k req/day)
   - **Timeline:** When adding real wallets

5. **No error monitoring**: Errors logged locally, not tracked
   - **Fix:** Add Sentry (free tier)
   - **Timeline:** This month

6. **WebSocket not broadcasting**: Server accepts connections but doesn't push updates
   - **Fix:** Implement Redis Pub/Sub
   - **Timeline:** This month

### Low Priority
7. **No historical charts**: Can't visualize wallet performance over time
8. **No machine learning**: All rules-based detection
9. **No auto-trading**: Can't execute trades automatically
