# üß™ Test Your Telegram Bot Right Now

## If Your Anthropic Key Was Already Used Today

That means the key is likely **already set in Railway**! Let's test if the bot is working:

## ‚úÖ Quick Test (2 minutes)

### **Step 1: Find Your Bot**

You need your bot's username. Here's how:

1. Open Telegram
2. Search for `@BotFather`
3. Send `/mybots`
4. Click on your bot
5. You'll see the username (like `@your_aura_bot`)

### **Step 2: Start Chatting**

1. Search for your bot username in Telegram
2. Click "START" or send `/start`
3. You should see a welcome message

### **Step 3: Test Natural Language**

Send these messages (just type normally, no slash):

```
how's my portfolio?
```

or

```
why no signals today?
```

or

```
what's the system status?
```

### **Expected Response:**

**If Anthropic API key is working:**
```
ü§ñ Your portfolio is currently showing 0 open positions...
```

**If key NOT working (fallback mode):**
```
ü§î I understand you're asking about: how's my portfolio?

üíº Current Portfolio:
‚Ä¢ Open Positions: 0
...
```

## üîç Check Bot Status from Terminal

```bash
# Check if service is healthy
curl -s https://signal-railway-deployment-production.up.railway.app/health | jq

# Should show:
# "status": "healthy"
```

---

## üö® If Bot Still Not Responding

### **Option 1: Get Your Bot Username**

If you don't remember your bot username:

1. Look in your Telegram chat history
2. Or message @BotFather and send `/mybots`
3. Your bot will be listed there

### **Option 2: Check Bot Token**

Your bot token: `8305979428:AAHoWtmCGgndUZvdrA-vHmnNqyxun53V9_Y`

Search for this in Telegram:
- The numbers before the `:` are the bot ID
- Search for bots with ID `8305979428`

### **Option 3: Create a Test Message**

Send this to @BotFather:
```
/newbot
```

Then check if you already have a bot created.

## üí° Alternative: Direct API Test

If the bot isn't responding via Telegram, you can test the Telegram API directly:

```bash
# Check if bot is valid
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot8305979428:AAHoWtmCGgndUZvdrA-vHmnNqyxun53V9_Y/getMe"

# Should return bot info if token is valid
```

## üéØ What to Look For

### **Bot IS Working:**
- ‚úÖ Bot responds to `/start`
- ‚úÖ Bot responds to "how's my portfolio?"
- ‚úÖ Responses are contextual and helpful

### **Bot NOT Working:**
- ‚ùå No response to any messages
- ‚ùå "Bot not found" when searching
- ‚ùå Can't find bot username

---

## üìä Use Dashboard Instead (While Testing)

Your dashboard is working perfectly:
- **URL:** https://signal-railway-deployment-production.up.railway.app/dashboard
- Shows all the same data the bot would show
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds

---

## üîß If You Need to Debug

### **Check Telegram Bot Username:**

Run this command to get bot info:
```bash
curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot8305979428:AAHoWtmCGgndUZvdrA-vHmnNqyxun53V9_Y/getMe" | jq
```

Look for the `"username"` field - that's what you search for in Telegram!

### **Check Recent Updates:**

```bash
curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot8305979428:AAHoWtmCGgndUZvdrA-vHmnNqyxun53V9_Y/getUpdates" | jq
```

This shows if anyone has messaged the bot.

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Get bot username** from @BotFather
2. **Search for bot** in Telegram
3. **Send `/start`**
4. **Test with "how's my portfolio?"**

If it works ‚Üí Great! Your Anthropic key is already set.
If it doesn't work ‚Üí Let me know what error/response you get!
